## Hi there! 👋

I'm Felipe Amaro, a Computer Science student driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and the desire to build software that truly makes an impact. Welcome to my development journey!

## About Me

Hi! I'm Felipe Amaro, a Back-End Developer passionate about building robust, scalable and well-architected systems.
I currently work at Smit Soluções Mobile, developing modern web applications and contributing to internal platforms that improve productivity and business workflows.

Although my main focus is on the back-end, I also have solid experience with front-end development, especially using React and Vue, enabling me to collaborate across the full stack when needed.
I value clean code, performance, maintainability, and continuous learning.
